Maria Mance,Mobility Training Wanted!,https://simbi.com/maria-mance/mobility-training-wanted,"I'm looking for someone who's willing to do a personal training session with me centered on strength and mobility. I've been seeing a lot of free exercises on social media for not only increasing range of motion but also increasing strength throughout that range. Think: ATG/knees over toes guy, beard the best you can be, etc. While free content is helpful, it's impersonal and you can't always get your questions answered. This is why I'd like someone who can help me in real time and tell me what I'm doing wrong and how to do it better. I'd rather know than figure it out the hard way! I worry I'll do a movement wrong and just end up injuring myself worse in the process!"
