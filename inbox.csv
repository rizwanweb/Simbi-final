Maria Mance,Mobility Training Wanted!,https://simbi.com/maria-mance/mobility-training-wanted,"I'm looking for someone who's willing to do a personal training session with me centered on strength and mobility. I've been seeing a lot of free exercises on social media for not only increasing range of motion but also increasing strength throughout that range. Think: ATG/knees over toes guy, beard the best you can be, etc. While free content is helpful, it's impersonal and you can't always get your questions answered.

I worry I'll do a movement wrong and just end up injuring myself worse in the process!"
